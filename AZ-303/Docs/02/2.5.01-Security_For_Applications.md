## 2.5 Manage Security For Applications:

### 2.5.1 Configure KeyVault:

* 
  * `Secrets Management` - To Securely store and tightly control access to `tokens`, `passwords`, `certificates`, `API keys`, and other secrets
  * `Key Management` - used as `Key Management` solution - Create and Renew keys used to encrypt your data.
  * `Certificate Management` - It helps in enroll, manage, and deploy public and private `Transport Layer` | `Security/Secure Sockets Layer` - `(TLS/SSL) Certificates` for use with Azure and your internal connected resources.

### 2.5.2 Configure Managed Identities:

* List the secrets in the key vault

```sh
az keyvault secret list --vault-name <Vault_Name>
```

* List the value of a particular secret

```sh
az keyvault secret show --vault-name <Vault_Name> --id "https://<Vault_Name>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<ID>"
```

* Mark a disabled secret and enabled

```sh
az keyvault secret set-attributes --name <secret_name> --vault-name <Vault_Name> --version "03daa86af5894027890852d0d8e76d04" --enabled true
```

### 2.5.3 Register and Manage applications in Azure AD:

* The APp has to be registered in AAD.
* AAD -> `New App registration` -> Done
  * It generates `Client_ID` & `Tenant_ID` for the App.
  * Then We need to generate `Client_Secret` : new app --> `certificates & Secrets` --> `New Client Secret` --> Generate
* In the local Application, `Client_ID`, `Client_Secret` & `Tenant_ID` has to be embeded while hitting Az Key Vault URL. --> This way, Authentication & Authorization of app will happen.
