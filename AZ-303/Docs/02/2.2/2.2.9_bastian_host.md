## [Bastion Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview):

* Bastion Host works as jump server.
* For security purpose, only Jump server should be exposed to Internet. Then from jump server, connectivity to internal app-servers should be allowed though rules in NSG/ASG.
* In place of deploying a jumpserver in a separate subnet & configuring all routing policies, Azure provides a service i.e Bastion Host service.
  * Subnet name must be = `AzurebastionSubnet` { *Imp* }
  * Azure Bastion Host is a `Managed Service`
  * Azure Bastion Host will  be deployed per Virtual Network
  *
