# Virtual Machines:

### 1.4.1 High Availability for VM :
  * Ideally SLA for VM - 99.90%, with `Availability_Set`: `99.95%`, `Availability Zones`: `99.99%`
  * No Additional cost for Av_Set/Av_Zones. Only the extra cost for communication among DCs in the Av_zones.
  * [**Availability Set vs Availability Zones**](../../Day-02#availability-set-vs-availability-zone)
    * *[Suggestion]* If VM is part of Availability_Set => Use `Managed Disks` 
    * *[Suggestion]* Front-end & Back-end => Configure 2 diff availability Sets 
    * Falut-Domain = 3 (Max) & Update Domain = 20 (max)
    * *[Imp_Note]* While creating a new VM only, we can assign that to an Av_Set. We cant assign it to any AV_Set after VM is deployed.

  * Types of VMs:

### 1.4.2 Azure Disk for VMs:

* Managed Disk: Microsoft takes responsibility of HA of Disk, Data redundancy etc.

* Un-Managed Disk: Manually manage the disk.

* Add Disk to VM: V -> DIsk -> Add new Disk -> Define Size,Type etc & save --> Done

### 1.4.3 Select virtual machine size:

* Check the Quota in Subscription -> Then identify the pending scalable quota. 
* VM -> Size -> change the size of VM.

###  1.4.4 Dedicated Host:
  * Large organizations can opt for dedicated host i.e entire underlying hardware, where they can host thier own VMS. 
  * They can control the downtime/any maintenance activity related to that host.
  * No other company can host thier VM onto those dedicated hosts.
  * Min requirement is to subscribe for 96vcpus allocated to subscription.

### 1.4.5 VM Scale Sets:
  * VM Scale Set is the resource, which starts with min set of VMs & can extend upto a Max no of identical VMs.
  * How to balance loads betwn multiple VMs, Scale Set is used i.e `Auto sclaing up/down` of the VMs based on some conditions.
  * Scale set allows to manage `identical VMs`
  * It provides better redudancy for VMs.
  * When Scaleset scales up the instance, the new VM will be only the replica of 1st, but the applications will not be installed/run on the other vm.
  * Scaleset is basically tied up with LB. So new requests to newly scalled VMs, will be routed from the LB of scale set.
  * While creating Scale set, we can select multiple Av_Zones, so that the scalled VMs will be spinned in diff zones.

### 1.4.6 Configure Azure Disk Encryption:

  * VM -> Disks -> Encryption -> Default `(Encryption at Rest with PMK)`
  *

  * [More Points](../02/2.5.01-Security_For_Applications.md#252-configure-managed-identities)
  
  * Both Managed & Unmanaged Disks can be Encrypted, 

### 1.4.7 Create VM Image:
  * This process called : Generalization of VM.
  * Its a destructive process i.e the VM used to create the image, cant be used further.
  * The process: 
    * S/w required to perform this task should be installed in the VM to proceed with it.
    * Inside the VM, go to system32/sysprep, execute `sysprep` -> Generalize --> Shutdown 
    * Stop the VM: `Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName azuredemo -Name <VM_Name> -Force`
    * Now in protal, `Capture Image` -> provide input -> Done
    * Search Image in portal, you would find it available.


### 1.4.8 Attach secondary NIC to VM:

  * SubnetB - Hosts applications. 
  * SubnetA - Contains VM exposed to Internet.
  * VMs in SubnetB connects to Internet through VM(subnetA)-> Acts as Appliance.
  * VM(subnetA) needs to have 2 NICs i.e one NIC - (with 1 Private/Public IP) & 2nd NIC - (Private IP from SubnetB), so that It connects to VMS in SubnetB.
  * VM(SubnetA) neds to have necessary Software installed to function as appliance.

### 1.4.9 Create Image from VM:

* Creating Image of a VM is a destructive process.
* Login to VM -> execute the tool to build image - `system32 -> sysprep`

* Then deallocate the VM -> Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName <RG_Name> -Name <VM>
* From Portal -> VM -> Overview -> `Capture` -> Done
   
### 1.4.10 VM Backup:

* `Automated Backup v2` automatically configures Managed Backup to Microsoft Azure for all existing.

> Notes:
 * **The virtual machine and network interface need to be in the same region as the virtual network.**
 * **VM depends on NIC; NIC depends on VNET.**
