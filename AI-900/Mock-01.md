Microsoft defines this Computer Vision technique in the following way:"An advanced machine learning technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong."What is the name of this common Computer Vision task?

Correct answer (Semantic Segmentation): Semantic Segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel in an image to associate it with a particular object class. This allows for a more detailed understanding of the image, beyond simple object detection or classification.

Semantic Segmentation

Which of the following metrics are used by Azure Machine Learning to evaluate regression models? (Select all that apply.)

Correct answers (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)): For regression models, Azure ML typically evaluates performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R-Squared. These metrics help determine how closely the predicted values match the actual values. Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are more appropriate for classification tasks rather than regression.

An application scans an image and quickly returns information such as regions, text lines, and words from each line of text. Which Computer Vision API does the application use for image scanning?

Correct answer (OCR): Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that allows applications to recognize and extract text from images. The OCR capability in Azure Computer Vision can identify and extract text by scanning images, providing detailed information about regions, lines, and words. Options like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Understanding (LUIS) are more relevant to processing text after it has been extracted, rather than scanning images for text.

Select all emotion attributes that Azure Cognitive Face service can detect:

Correct answers (fear, smile, contempt, surprise, neutral): Azure Cognitive Face service detects emotions such as happiness (smile), surprise, fear, contempt, and neutrality, among others. Emotions like "hate" or "sparkle" are not included in the standard set of recognized expressions.

fear,smile,contempt,surprise,neutral

What services are involved in live speech translation? (Select all that apply.)

Correct answers (Speech-to-Text, Language Detection, Machine Translation, Text-to-Speech): Live speech translation involves converting spoken language to text, detecting the language, translating the text, and then converting it back to speech in the target language. These components work together to provide seamless translation.

You are using the Analyze Image API to gather information about an image. The API response includes a likelihood indicating that the image belongs to one of two content types. What are these content types?

Correct answers (Clip Art, Photo): The Analyze Image API can classify images based on their content type, specifically identifying whether an image is a "Photo" (a real-world picture captured by a camera) or "Clip Art" (a graphical image, often simplified and stylized). This helps in understanding the nature of the image and applying relevant processing or filtering techniques.

You work for a major airline. The airline is planning to implement new services for the premium cabin. You have been asked to predict whether elite members of a frequent flyer program favor these services or not. You decided to implement Clustering modeling. Does this decision help you achieve your goal?

Correct answer (No): Clustering is used for grouping similar data points together without predefined labels. However, predicting whether members favor the service or not is a classification problem, where the goal is to assign data points to specific classes (favor or not favor). Therefore, classification modeling would be more appropriate.

No

You created a Custom Vision model using the Custom Vision portal. What information do you need to provide to the developers to use this model?

Correct answers (Project ID, Prediction key, Prediction endpoint): When deploying a Custom Vision model, developers need the Project ID to identify the model, the Prediction key for authentication, and the Prediction endpoint to send requests to the service.

You are designing a pipeline in Azure Machine Learning Designer and need to run a custom script. Which programming languages can you use for executing code in Azure ML Designer? (Select all that apply.)

Correct answers (Python, R): Azure ML Designer supports the execution of custom scripts primarily in Python and R. These languages are widely used for data science and machine learning tasks, allowing users to integrate custom logic and models into their pipelines. Other languages, like C++, Java, and JavaScript, are not natively supported for direct code execution within Azure ML Designer.

What metrics does Azure ML use for the evaluation of the Clustering models? (Select all that apply.)

Correct answers (Combined Evaluation, Average Distance to Cluster Center): Clustering models are generally evaluated based on metrics that assess the compactness and separability of clusters, such as the average distance to the cluster center. Combined evaluation can include measures like intra-cluster distance and silhouette score. RMSE, accuracy, precision, and coefficient of determination are more typical of regression and classification models.

Select all examples of applications that use image classification techniques.

Correct answers (Detecting tumors on X-ray images, Visual product search, Face recognition, Categorizing animal species from photos): Image classification is a technique that identifies the category to which an object in an image belongs. Examples include detecting medical conditions (e.g., tumors in X-rays), recognizing and searching products visually, identifying faces, and classifying images of animals. Recognizing text in images typically falls under optical character recognition (OCR), while entity recognition is a natural language processing (NLP) task related to text analysis, not image classification.

What is the name of the metric that uses the TP/(TP+FN) expression for its value calculation?

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is calculated as the ratio of True Positives (TP) to the sum of True Positives and False Negatives (TP+FN). It measures how well the model identifies all relevant positive cases.

You are building an AI solution within a framework of governance and organizational requirements reflecting legal and ethical standards. What responsible AI principle are you following?

Correct answer (Accountability): Building AI solutions under legal and ethical standards aligns with the Principle of Accountability. It ensures that AI development and deployment follow best practices and guidelines to prevent misuse or harm.

Accountability

You install a Visual product search application on your mobile. The application searches products based on their images that you capture on a mobile camera. What Computer Vision common task does this application use for the product search?

Correct answer (Image classification): Image classification involves identifying objects within an image and categorizing them. For a visual product search, the application needs to recognize and classify images, which is a typical use case for image classification.

You need to translate a short document into several languages. You decided to use Translator API. Can you submit a text to get translations in all required languages in a single request?

Correct answer (Yes): The Translator API allows you to submit a text and get translations in multiple languages in a single request, simplifying the translation process for multilingual requirements.
