## Storage Account:

* Create resource -> Create Storage_Account -> `Unique Name`
  * Performance: 
    * Standard (General Purppose v2) : blob, file, queue, table, datalake
    * Premium: service specic (blob/file/queue/table)
  * Redundancy: LRS/ZRS / GRS / GZRS
  * Protection: 
    * Enable soft delete for blobs: can be restored back after certain days
  * Networkging:
    * Firewall & Vnet:
      * Allow connections from specific `selected network` i.e CIDR range

### Data Protection:

* Options inside SA:
  * Containers: like a directory. 
    * protection: private (no aunonymous access), blob , <>
    * Upload data as blob. (considered as object in blob)
* Usecase:
    * A webapp uses storage acc to store its videos/data files. 
    * How to access storage-acc from the app: (diff topic)
    * `File Share`: A drive/containers can be mapped to a fileshare.  
        * create quota for fileshare
        * add directories in it & then upload files.
    * `blob`: stores as object; access through URL.
* Azure Storage Explorer:
    * Download the tool to local. Login to azure through explorer.
    * Copy azure key1 from portal: storage-account -> access keys -> copy key/name & configure to storage explorer to handle further modifications.


### Authorize user/app to access services in storage account:
  #### 1. `Access Keys`:
   * Under St Ac -> Access Keys -> show keys
     * Copy only Key1/Key2 & it can be configured in azure storage explorer to connect to SA.
       * In `azure storage explorer` Add storage account.
       * Provide key, acc name & then connect.
       * Once done, dettach the account in `azure storage explorer`
     * Access Key gives full authorization to `all resources` (blob/file-share/tables etc)
 #### 2. Shared Access Signature (SAS Token): 
  * SAS can be generated at SA label/Blob Lavel
    * Blob-Lavel:
      * Go to SA -> container -> blob -> Generate SAS -> key (provide expiry date)
      * Copy the SAS blob URL & try to access it from browser --> Works
    * Account lavel:
      * Go to SA  -> Shared Access Signature(Left) -> Select services (blob/table/queue) -> Allowed resources (Select all --> Generate SAS Token (key1) (provide expiry date)
      * Configure the SAS Toekn URL in `azure storage explorer` & add account. Then respective services can be accessed 
 #### 3. Stored Access policy:
  * SA -> containers -> `Access Policy` -> `Add policy`  -> provide name & expiry time 
    * With SAS token -> Associate `Stored Access Policy`, so that the expiry date/time & scope can be controlled with `Stored Access Policy`
    * Storage Account -> Storage Explorer -> select blob -> `generate Shared Access Signature` -> Select above created policy -> 
    * Later point of time, if needed to pre-expire the access, just edit the `Stored Access Policy` & its applicable to the container.
 #### 4. Active Directory Authentication:
  * In Azure AD, create a user & go to SA -> IAM -> Add role assignment -> add role & user.

* Usecase:
  * 1st pref: Azure AD approach. 
  * 2nd Pref: Shsared Access Signature (SAS Token)
  * 3rd Pref: Access Keys (Last)

   
* [Storage Account Replication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy): 
  * LRS
  * ZRS
  * GRS
  * GZRS
  * RA-GZRS

### Access Tiers:
  * Hot (Apears while creating SA)
  * Cool (Apears while creating SA)
  * Archive (Option apear at blob lavel)
    * We cant access data directly in this access tier. 
    * To access data, we need to change the tier from Archive --> Hot/Cool. This takes Standard(upto 15hrs)/Hot(1hr for 10Gb of data)
  
 ### Life Cycle Management for Storage-Account:
 
  * It is diffuclt to change the access tier for indivisual blob. So to simplify this, LifeCycleManagement is used.
    * We can define Rules -> Change Tier/Delete Object/other
    * 
  * SA -> Blob-serice -> LifeCycleManagement -> `Add Rule`
    * eg: - If blobs not acccessed in lastr 30 days, it changes into Hot by default.
    
  * Change Replication for SA: (LRS -> ZRS)
    * Manual Migration: Might be downtime & few might not be possible for us to achive
    * Config Update: SA-> Configuration -> Change Replication to ZRS/GRS/RA-GRS
    * Create new St Ac & then migrate manually. No new data shoiuld be created meanwhile.
    * LRS ==> GZRS/RA-GRS
      * Convert LRS -> GRS/RA-GRS
      * Then request for Live-Migration
    * GRS/RA-GRS ==> ZRS
      * Convert from GRS --> LRS
      * Then request Live-Migration
 
 ### Performance in SA:
  * While creating SA, we can select Storage_Account Performance (Standard/Premium).
  * Premium -> Account Kind(Storage Purpose v2) --> its for VM HDDs storage. Performance will be enhanced. But no hot/cold/archive kind of option for blob will NOT be available.
  * Premium -> Account Kind(Block Blob Storage) --> High performance for Blob storage
  * Premium -> Account Kind(File storage) --> High performance for File storage
  * `Archive` Access Tier: To change access tier, `Rehydrate` the files (`Standard Priority`:-15Hrs time & `High priority`:- 1hr for 10GB data) -> Change tier `Hot`/`Cold` 

> **Notes:**
* Account Type: `General Purpose V2` --> storage accounts with VM HDD can be stored, ZRS is applicable only in this Account Type. 
* Only Blob serice allows to achrive the data.
