## 2.1 Manage workloads in Azure


### 2.1.0 What is Azure Migrate Service ?
  
* Azure Migrate provides a centralized hub to assess and migrate to Azure on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data.

### 2.1.1 How to Migrate  Workloads using Azure Migrate Service:

* Streps involved in Migration:
  * Setup `Azure Asessment Appliance`
    * `Assess` your existing VM/Workoads by Assessment appliance.
    * Transfers all the `assessment report` to Azure migrate Service - cost 
    * 

### [2.1.2 implement Azure Backup for VMs:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction)

* `Azure Backup` provides independent and isolated backups of Data. This data is getting stored in `Recovery Service vault`
* **Azure Recovery Service Vault:** Backups are stored in a Recovery Services vault with built-in management of `Recovery points`
* As part of the backup process, a **`Snapshot`** is taken, and the data is transferred to the Recovery Services vault with no impact on production workloads
* Snapshots can be taken with different labels of [consistency:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction#snapshot-consistency)
  * Application-consistent
  * File-system consistent
  * Crash-consistent
* We can set `Replication Policy` for backup. `Recovery Point Retention` is set to 24hrs. `App Consistent Snapshots` set.

### 2.1.3 implement disaster recovery

* **Azure Site Recovery Service:** Used to replicate data to secondary region to avoid any sort of disaster.
  *  `For VMS`: 
    *  VM -> Disaster Recovery -> Chose target Region -> RG/Vnet etc wll be created -> New `Cache Storage Ac` created -> New `Recovery Service vault` in Target region created
    *  If we check Recvery service vault in target region -> Only Data replication started

### [2.1.4 Implement Azure Update Management:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/update-management/overview)

* To manage OS upgrade in VMs, Azure Update Management service is used.
* Add the VM to Update Management
* 2 Agents will be installed on the VMs:
  * `Hybrid Runbook Worker` installed on VM --> Communicated with Azure `Automation Ac`
  * `Log Analytics Agent` installed on VM --> Communicated with Azure `Log Analytics Workspace`

* Update Management is free. Manage Onprem & Azure VMs for update management.
* Azure Automation Ac -> Update Management -> Add VM -> Schedule Update -> Select group(Linux/Windows) -> Select VMs -> Select specific types of updates -> Schedule it -> Done
* Detailed explanation [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HPUKgKYNeY) ; [Plan your update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/update-management/plan-deployment)
