## Azure Networking

### [1.6.0 Concepts of Virtual Network & Subnet:](https://github.com/hmsvigle/Azure/tree/Az-303-My-Notes-V2/AZ-303/Edureka/Day-02#azure-virtual-network-azure-vn)
  * Public IP Address: Communication to Internet
  * Private IP Address: Communication between Virtual Networks / Subnets / with-in an onprem nw
  * There are 2 SKUs for Public IP Address: 
    * Basic: 
      * `Static` / `Dynamic` IP Address
      * `NSG` (*Optional*) - restrict public ip
      * `NO` Support for `Av Zone`
    * Standard SKU: 
      *  `Static` IP Address
      *  `NSG` is `required` to restrict traffic
      *  `Zone Redundant` is Default

### IP Addressing:
  * IP has 10.0.0.5 --> each bit consists of 8 bits i.e [0000 1010] . [0000 0000] . [0000 0000] . [0000 0101] 
  * CIDR = `10.0.0.0/24` --> 24 bits (1st three bits) are fixed & remaining (32-24) 8 bits can be adjusted to get the IPs, which can be assigned to VMS
  * so we can change the last bit & get the IPs, which can be assigned to VMs. i.e 10.0.0.[0000 0000] - 10.0.0.[1111 1111] --> 256 IPs 
  * If we create a subnet i.e 10.0.0.0/16 -> 2 bits are fixed & remaining 2 bits can be assigned to Hostnames. 
    * We define subnets i.e 10.0.1.0/24  | 10.0.2.0/24  | . . . . . | 10.0.255.0/24
    * Each subnet can again have 256 IPs.
  * Azure by default blocks 5 IPs from every subnet for its own usage. so total 251 IPs are available.
  * > Note: If no VMs assigned to a subnet, then we can update the address space, if already some vms asigned, then we cant update subnet ip address.
  * **NIC:** - It assigns private / public IP to VM. We can have 2 NICs assigned to a VM [Eg](./1.4_VMs.md#148-attach-secondary-nic-to-vm);  which can have only public & private IPs assigned to VM, so that public Ip can be internet facing & private IP can be used for internal communications.
 
  * **NSG:** 
    * NSG can be `attached at Subnet` 
      * create NSG (select vnet) --> go to subnets --> Associate with Vnet & subnet --> Inbound/Outbound Security Rules --> Add rule for traffic.
    * NSG can be attached to `VMs @ NIC layer`

    * NSG Inbound Rule Based on: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24938159/123749466-1790d980-d8d3-11eb-9fa7-f70665fe0d6a.png" width="250"> 

   
     
  * **Application Security Group:** ASG can be assigned to VM(s) running the application. In NSG of DB-Vms, we can add rule for ASG only.
    * VNET -> { App-VM (ASG) ---> DB-VM (NSG) } ==> In NSG(db), add rule to allow traffic only from ASG(app), instead of adding Private IPs of all VMs(App).

### Usecase:

* Deploy Vnet [10.0.0.0/16]
* Deploy subnets :- SubnetA [10.0.1.0/24] &  jumpSubnetA [10.0.2.0/24]
* Deploy jumpServer VM:
  * Give Public IP
  * Assign to jumpSubnetA
  * Networking --> Add inbound Rule (1. Deny all from virtualnetwork & 2. Allow only Personal IP to specific port)
* Deploy DemoVM to SubnetA
  * Disable Public IP
  * Networking --> Add inbound Rule (1. Deny all from virtualnetwork & 2. Allow only Private IP of jumpserver to specific port)
     
### Service-EndPoints:

* Normally when we try to access any Azure service (i.e Public IP) from a VM (Private IP), The private IP of VM *translates into Public IP* & connect to azure service public ip. 
* So there is a `transition` *from Private to Public network* & then *Back to establish connection*. Its a Risky step. 
* Hence, VNet `Service Endpoint` provides a secure and direct connectivity to Azure services. Here an optimized Route over `Azure backbone Network` opens up, which enables identies of the Azure service & subnet of VM. 
  * We can add an Outbound rule in NSG of VM to allow connection to azure service (eg- storage ac etc...). 
  * which means: *Vm's Private IP* --> *Public IP* --> [*Possibility of glitch*] --> Azure Service 
* Secure way to strictly enable direct route between VM & add Azure service is - Service-Endpoint.
  * Enable Service-endpoint at VM (Vnet)

  * Now add the Vnet to your storage account.

  * **Limitations**: Storage AC & Vnet, where application-VM is running, should be deployed in the same **`Region`**.
  
### Service-Endpoint-Policy: 

  * What if there are multiple storage accounts in the same resourcegroup. And somebody is trying to exfiltrate data to another storage-ac as well. 
  * To restrict data exfiltration, we define service-endpoint-Policy to define what all stg-acc are allowed for the connection.

### Private-Endpoint:

  * Its like connecting to private IP of storage account in the same subnet. 
  * With private end-point, the entire storage ac is assigned a nic (private ip from the subnet of app-VM). 
  * Storage-Acc --> networking --> Private end-point --> Add --> select RG --> service(blob/...) --> vnet (where vm is deployed) --> Done

## [1.6.1 Types of Conections:](https://github.com/hmsvigle/Azure/tree/Az-303-My-Notes-V2/AZ-303/Edureka/Day-03#types-of-connections)
  
### 1.6.1 Custom Routes:

 * VM-A --> VM-B --> VM-C
   * VM-B acting as `Virtual-Appliance`, i.e all the traffic to VM-C has to go through VM-B
   * Create a Route Table:
     * Address space: entire VNet
     * Target : Virtual Appliance i.e Pvt IP of `VM-B`
   * Associate the Route Table with VM-A (associate with subnet of VM-A)
   * Install Routing packages in VM-B to enable it as appliance.
   * IP Forwarding for VM-B:
     * VM-B --> NIC --> IP Config --> `IP Forwarding` (enable)
   * Test the configuration:
     * Install IIS in VM-C
     * Try to access the URL of VM-C from VM-A


### 1.6.2 Virtual Network Peering:

* By default VMs communication in single Vnet is allowable.
* VM communication between 2 Vnets - Not possible by default
* Solution : `Vnet Peering`
* Vnet peering can be done between VNets of `2 Diff` **`Regions`**/**`subscriptions`**.

 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24938159/119131474-29bb6480-ba57-11eb-9126-19b2919d61f9.png" width="400">


 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24938159/119132539-75bad900-ba58-11eb-99cd-7c9f91caec16.png" width="500">

   * Staging-Vnet --> Peering --> Add peering. It creates peers at both sides.


### 1.6.3 Pont-To-Site VPN Connection:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24938159/119146893-b6225300-ba68-11eb-990e-4e158267e848.png" width="500">

* For P2S VPn connection, **`VN Gateway`** is required, which will deploy few VMs in a diff subnet i.e **`GatewaySubnet`**.
* Finally those vms will play role in identifying the connection from client side workstation, using the public key configured into VPN Gateway.
* Also the Client side Workstations should have Private key & VPN client configured. 

* **Azure Side Steps:**
  * Create a VNET & SubnetA --> Deploy a VM
  * VNET --> subnet --> Subnet Gateway --> Define IP ranges & Create
  * Deploy VN Gateway --> attach to the Subnet Gateway (created above) --> define public IP --> Submit
  * For P2S configuration in VN Gateway, Public key of self-signed certificate is required.
  * 

* **Client side Certificates:**

  ```sh
  // To generate the root certificate
  $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature `
  -Subject "CN=RootCertificate" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
  -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
  -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign
  ```
  ```sh
  // To generate the client certificate
  New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -DnsName P2SChildCert -KeySpec Signature `
  -Subject "CN=ClientCertificate" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
  -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
  -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
  -Signer $cert -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2")
  ```

### 1.6.4 Site-To-Site VPN Connection:

* [ On-Prem DataCeter(VMs) ]   <==={Secure Tunner}===>  [ Azure Network ]   ==> S2S VPN Conn

* **Azure Side:**
  * Deploy Gateway Subnet
  * Deploy VM (private IP) on Subnet in Azure VNet
  * Deploy `VNet Gateway`:
    * Select Higher SKU i.e `Vpngw2`, it gives more options like authentication techniques
    * Under tab `Connection` --> Add Connection --> `S2S Conection` --> Select Gateway Subnet --> Select Local Gateway --> enter `secret key` (Remember this) --> Done
  * Deploy `Local Gateway`: 
    * Represents N/w infrastructure layout of On-Prem
    * Public IP of On-Prem @ Local-Gateway config
    * IP range of On-Prem VMs @ Local-Gateway config
  
* **On-Prem Network:**
  * VM on On-Prem Vnet
  * Install Roles & Routing packages on VM
  * To identify Azure-Network infra, It has to connect to Pub-IP of VN Gateway
  *

* Use Remote Virtual Nw Gateway while peering azure Vnet1 with Vnet2
